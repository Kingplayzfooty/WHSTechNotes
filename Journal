I think there should be a calorie bot.
Many people are unhealthy and i beileve this
bot could prove to be very useful. As I was saying,
many people are not in shape or healthy especially here
in the U.S. we rank 36th for women and 10th for highest
obesity rates. People also can have conditions like underactive 
thyroid (hypothyroidism), Cushing syndrome, and Polycystic 
Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). These can all cause people to gain weight
or even not be able to lose any at all. Those are just two examples
I beleive a calorie bot could peole a lot with their physical well-
being. Now as to the bot, a simple design would be a program that could 
be able to set reminders to people who might over eat or feel tempted to.
Another great addtion to that would be if you could take a picture of whatever 
you eat and the bot would tell you many calories your about to eat, how many you've
eaten so far, and also remind you how much you have left before you reach your limit.
This could help people with proportion, learing how to set limits, and deny the body.
I think this bot could be very helpful to not just U.S. but everyone on the globe.

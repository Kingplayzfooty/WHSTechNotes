Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

My thoughts on the cell phone law are mostly negative to be honest. 
I beleive creating a law over students using their cell phones is way to overboard, 
its just too much strictness over something so little. There are many negatives to this big change, there are still some positives
but I think its just too risky too gamble students and teachers saftey over them using phones on school grounds. Like for example,
if there is a dangerous situation (campus threat level) and no one can use their phones how can anyone else contact authoraties
or saftey/help? Now of course the responsibility should depend on admin, but its always good to prepare for the worst, incase a 
teacher or even student needs to help out. Another point i've come across, is rapidness in contacting. What I mean by that, is
what if parents or teachers need to hurry and leave school because someone dear to them is in trouble, possibly about to pass away,
hurt, or anything, you never know. Teachers and students not being able to quickly contact whoever they need to could pose a big obstacle
in the way seeing or helping a loved one for the last time. This is mainly torwards studnets because the office has to call their name in
the classroom, then they have to pack their stuff, walk to office, and this all takes a lot of time especially if they dont know whats going
on, vs a teacher being able to just leave and drive off wherever it is they need to go. Although i have mentioned some important negatives
to definently think about, one big positive is the phone law helps students with their attention spans. I feel like all of these apps are 
making everyone's attention span lower and lower by the day including myself, but especially students since most are kids. So I will say, 
the phone law does helps us take a break and actually learn something, while also preventing us from "doom scrolling" on these apps 
and destroying our attention span. With all of that being said, my thoughts on the cell phone law have yet to change and that is why.

I think computer science is valuable in soccer.
Computer science can help you create websites that track any 
players stats and public information about the player. I 
also think computer science can help with selling tickets,
like if you make the website easily accessable, attention grabing,
and easily navigatable, you can use those (computer science) to
help with key parts of a soccer match. Some examples are FIFA.com 
and Fbref.com. Looking at the sites they show just how to perfectly
use computer science while involing soccer. It shows all of the 
hard work of coding while still grabbing a fan's attention. Another
thing in soccer that we use to this day during is soccer is called 
VAR (Video Assistance Reffere) this helps ALOT due to refs only being 
able to do so much if they cant see, especially when players try to sneak
in a bit of foul play. This invloves computer science by needing people to
code the drones so they work properly while flying in the air. These are a 
few reasons of how sports, especially soccer could always use a bit of help 
regarding computer science. I think they fit perfectly well with each other,
and also benefit one another. With all of that being said, that is why I beleive
computer science is valuable in soccer.

I think there should be a calorie bot.
Many people are unhealthy and i beileve this
bot could prove to be very useful. As I was saying,
many people are not in shape or healthy especially here
in the U.S. we rank 36th for women and 10th for highest
obesity rates. People also can have conditions like underactive 
thyroid (hypothyroidism), Cushing syndrome, and Polycystic 
Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). These can all cause people to gain weight
or even not be able to lose any at all. Those are just two examples
I beleive a calorie bot could peole a lot with their physical well-
being. Now as to the bot, a simple design would be a program that could 
be able to set reminders to people who might over eat or feel tempted to.
Another great addtion to that would be if you could take a picture of whatever 
you eat and the bot would tell you many calories your about to eat, how many you've
eaten so far, and also remind you how much you have left before you reach your limit.
This could help people with proportion, learing how to set limits, and deny the body.
I think this bot could be very helpful to not just U.S. but everyone on the globe.

I think working in a virtual store isn't a good idea if your making real money. Although
 it's definetly good for training and maybe good to understand the job your applying for/
 possibly about to work for, yet I dont think it provides enough realistic training to the 
 employee. This could be dangerous especially with a place like IKEA. For example, if you are
 required to move some really heavy things or do a bit of labor, I dont think any online training
 could prepare you for actually completing this task in real life. Another reason why I dont think
 this virtual store job is a good idea, is because it dosen't teach you the responsibility of having
 a real job. There are many things that come with having a job; time management, money management, 
 social interaction, etc. These things teach you a very valuable lesson and can help you for the 
rest of your life. To give an example, imagine someone who wakes up late, stays inside all day, (anti social)
and eats/does whatever and whenever they want too. You could theoretically do these things with this virtual job.
Allowing many people to do this could ruin a good amount of lives. In conclusion, that is why I dont think working
in a virtual store is a good idea.

 ''6-7'' originated from a kid named Mason; at a basketball game and decided to say 6-7. It was uploaded online and became
 a trend/meme. The numbers 6-7 are commonly used in everyday life so its pretty easy to say it all the time, people say it
 just because they wanna say it. The trend is also easily recognized, and allows people to maybe even let out a little giggle.

If I were to be in charge of the school, my technology policy would be somewhat strict. I would allow informational
games, chromebooks, and cell phones only when students finish thier work. I wouldnt allow chat gpt due to cheating
possibilities. I think it could affect students learning by causing them to just cheat and not actually learn it 
themselves. This would make turn the school into a better learning envoirment for the students. It would allow them
to experience freedom but also not expose them to distractions/inappropriate things.

My prompt was designed to make a soccer workout plan for me to get better and stay active. Canva understood my prompt
excelently and built my idea better than I had envisioned it. The parts that worked very well to me, was the check
boxes that allowed you to mark workouts as completed and it also provided a percentage of how much youve completed 
for the week. The parts that didnt come out as expected was the workouts themselves, because I didnt specifiy and 
I didnt think it come up with such precise workouts that could target muscle groups and different drills to help
certain aspects of soccer. I think I could imporve my propmt to be better by more specific on what I want. Being
good at prompt engineering could be valuable in the future in order to help you keep track of things, come up with
new ideas and other things.

SNAP is a organization made to help fund families that may not be in the best of sistuations and need support
to afford their grocceries. If SNAP were to run out of funding forn those people, this would prove to be a BIG
problem. Many people depend on SNAP to take care of their food, so to take away that funding would greatly affect 
lots of families. I think apps could help connect families to alternet resources for food like, many people like
to give out food or donations, so this could help them not only get food but also different thins like clothes.
Now for the way they could connect, there are many apps such as facebook, nextdoor, twitter, and many more.
To be honest, any soical app can work, as long as you are specific about where and when you can donate. On 
the flip side, this could pose to be difficult as many families wouldnt be in this situation if they were
living comfortably, so they most likely wont have a cell phone, and maybe not even a car.
